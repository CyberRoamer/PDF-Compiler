# PDF-Compiler
The idea is to create a portable utility for manipulating and compiling PDF. Currently supports only windows. Can OCR, Compress, Filter, Deskew, Reorder Pages and Bookmark a PDF.

Uses flask, cropper, ocrmypdf, gs, docdetector, and andrewdcampbell's OpenCV-Document-Scanner.
Uses pyinstaller to create a portable exe.

To do list
1) Improve the js code for perception crop
2) Optimize the js code
3) other things that i forgot...

Future ideas
1) Improve corner detection
2) Improve filter
3) Improve compression methods
4) Improve UI
5) Improve workflow
6) Make it an app instead of using flask
7) Make it cross platform. 
8) other ideas which makes it better...
